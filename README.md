# Advanced Machine Design

This repository contains assignments, analyses, and design projects completed as part of my **Advanced Machine Design** graduate coursework. It focuses on the mechanical behavior of materials, design for strength and fatigue, and failure prediction under complex loading conditions.

## 📘 Overview

The work in this repository demonstrates applications of fundamental and advanced mechanical design principles, including:

- Stress and strain analysis under static and dynamic loading  
- Failure theories: **Maximum Shear Stress (Tresca)**, **Distortion Energy (von Mises)**, and **Coulomb-Mohr**  
- Shaft, gear, and fastener design based on **yield**, **fatigue**, and **endurance limits**  
- Analysis of **combined bending, torsion, and axial loads**  
- Use of safety factors and design margins for component reliability  
- Application of **finite element concepts** and comparison with analytical solutions  

## 🛠 Tools & Methods

- **Python** and **MATLAB** for numerical stress/strain computation and plotting  
- **SolidWorks / ANSYS** for CAD modeling and simulation  
- **Excel** for iterative design calculations and tabular data analysis  

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Apply mechanical design principles to real-world machine elements  
- Evaluate material behavior and select appropriate design criteria  
- Integrate analytical, computational, and experimental methods for design validation
